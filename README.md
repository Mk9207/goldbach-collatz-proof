# Constructive Proof of the Goldbach and Collatz Conjectures

This repository contains a unified constructive proof of both the Goldbach and Collatz conjectures. The approach utilizes AI-supported mathematical reasoning, structured number classification, and reduction functions.

## Summary

This work presents a fully constructive proof of both conjectures through explicit enumeration, classification, and elimination techniques. The proof strategy ensures reproducibility, convergence, and confluence based on number-theoretic properties.
