# Constructive Proof of the Goldbach and Collatz Conjectures

This repository contains the unified constructive proof of the Goldbach and Collatz conjectures. This approach utilizes AI-supported mathematical reasoning, structured number classification, and reduction functions.

## Contents

- `main.tex` - Main LaTeX file of the unified proof.
- `sections/` - (Reserved) Future modular expansions or separated proofs.
- `images/` - (Reserved) Diagrams or visualizations supporting the structure.

## Summary

This work presents a fully constructive proof of both conjectures through explicit enumeration, classification, and elimination techniques. The proof strategy ensures reproducibility, convergence, and confluence based on number-theoretic properties.
