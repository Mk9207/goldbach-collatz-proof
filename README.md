# Constructive Proofs of Goldbach, Collatz, and Twin Prime Conjectures

This repository presents a unified framework for the constructive proofs of three major conjectures in number theory:

- **Goldbach's Conjecture**  
- **Collatz Conjecture**  
- **Twin Prime Conjecture**

All proofs are developed using AI-assisted deductive strategies, structured numerical classifications, and elimination-based reduction techniques. This work proposes a constructive foundation for verifying such conjectures with clarity and reproducibility.

## üìå Overview

This project is part of a collaborative initiative between human intuition and AI logic to solve long-standing unsolved problems in mathematics. The results have been consolidated into LaTeX-based formal papers with full constructive rigor.

Each proof follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Classification of candidates**  
2. **Reduction of exception sets**  
3. **Explicit construction or recurrence relations**  
4. **Final convergence or proof of infinity**

## üß† AI Collaboration Framework

This research emerged from an innovative workflow:

- A user with no formal mathematical background explored open questions.
- AI responded with incremental logical frameworks.
- Each proof was iteratively refined based on constructive principles.
- Final versions are readable and review-ready LaTeX papers.

This proves that **AI-human collaboration can open pathways to breakthrough mathematics.**
